Files description:
- "geometry_2d_analysis.py" -> This program allows for geometric analysis of points and lines in 2D space. It can determine the equation of a line, check point-line relationships, perform translations and reflections. Results are visualized using the matplotlib library.
- "geometry_tasks" -> This notebook implements several geometric methods, including triangle area calculation, line-to-point distance, intersection of lines, and polygon representation. It also includes methods to verify if a point belongs to a shape (e.g. triangle or polygon) using two approaches. For each function, unit tests and visual representations are included to verify correctness.
- "convex_hull_algorithms" -> This notebook implements two convex hull algorithms that compute the convex boundary of a given set of points. It includes a function to read input points from a .txt file and visually compares the results of both algorithms. Additionally, it allows the user to load a custom object and compute its convex hull.
- "range_tree_1D_2D' -> This notebook implements range trees for both 1D and 2D data using integer coordinates. It includes search algorithms to find points within a specified range and provides complexity analysis. Results for different data sizes are visualized to compare memory usage and performance.
- "advancing_front_mesh_generator" -> This notebook implements a custom solution for front segment detection and mesh generation using the Advancing Front Method. The application supports loading 2D contour data, generates a mesh, and allows parameter control like mesh density.
- "delaunay_triangulation" -> This notebook implements Delaunay triangulation using the Bowyer-Watson algorithm.
- "interactive_ray_tracer" -> This Python script implements a simple ray tracing engine with a Tkinter-based GUI. It renders a 3D scene with a single sphere, allowing the user to adjust the sphere's position interactively and save the rendered image. Lighting and shading are calculated based on a directional light source to produce a diffuse effect.
